      <p>Having a proper Time Table is the key to success!</p>
      <br>
      <p>We all have 24 hours in a day. But why does it seem that some people are able to get the most out of every minute
        of the day?<br>
        Believe it or not, they don't have the power to slow down time.
        They do, however, know how to properly manage their time.<br><br>
        So it's better to plan the next day just before going to bed!
        <br><br><br></p>

      <p id="new">Here, I've created a simple time table system for you where you can plan your tasks for tomorrow!</p>
      <br>
      <p>Click on "Let's Build Your Time Table" and start organizing your day.</p>
